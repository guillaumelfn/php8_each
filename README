PHP Has a nice example that says the following :

$fruit = array('a' => 'apple', 'b' => 'banana', 'c' => 'cranberry');

reset($fruit);
while (list($key, $val) = each($fruit)) {
    echo "$key => $val\n";
}

It should return :

a => apple
b => banana
c => cranberry

Well, with my php8_each it does.
Just add the function anywhere you need each, so you dont have to change your code.

PHP is easy.
